Task 1:
Create a bar chart or histogram to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable, 
such as the distribution of ages or genders in a population.

Tools:
Python
Pandas library
Matplotlib library

Objective Task:
The objective of this task is to use Python along, with Matplotlib to analyze and visualize the distribution of age and gender, in the population.
The histogram shows how genders are distributed among the population. By examining the frequency of each gender we can gain insights, into patterns of gender distribution.
In conclusion this data science project utilizes Python and Matplotlib to create visualizations that offer an understanding of age and gender distributions in the world population. 
Further analysis and exploration can provide insights, into demographic patterns.
